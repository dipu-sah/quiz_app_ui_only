Assumptions:
in the dummy data validation:true/false will mean required:true/false, because nothing was explicitly mentioned
no extra keys will be provided apart from the dummy data keys and data types of the keys won't change
Not understood the subquestion key as it is empty every where
Nothing was mentioned about the libraries I can use apart from reactJs

Libraries used
ReactJs (to implement react UI)
Redux Tool Kit (for using redux)
MUI (For robust UI components)
Tailwind (for css classes as it is more flexible than bootstrap)
Swiper (to implement a carousel like view for the quiz questions)
ESLINT+Prettier (To organize code and uniform code formatting)
React-Router (Just to show I'm comfortable with this as well)
